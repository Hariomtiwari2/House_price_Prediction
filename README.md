Welcome to my second Machine Learning project! This project is a significant step forward in my journey of learning and applying machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems.

In this project, I built a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various factors such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and other features that influence property prices.

Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è
Python

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis

Numpy: For numerical operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization

Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating the machine learning model

XGBoost: For using gradient boosting techniques

What I Learned üìö
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data.

Feature Engineering: Identifying and using relevant features to improve model performance.

Model Building: Implementing machine learning models like Linear Regression and XGBoost.

Model Evaluation: Using performance metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R¬≤ to evaluate model accuracy.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning models to achieve better predictions.

Project Overview ‚ú®
The goal of this project is to predict house prices in a given dataset. The dataset includes various features such as the number of bedrooms, area, parking spaces, and whether the house is furnished or not. By training the model on this data, the goal is to predict the price of a house based on these inputs.
